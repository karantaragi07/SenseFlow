ðŸ“˜ SenseFlow: Real-time Sensor Data Pipeline using Kafka & Spring Boot

SenseFlow simulates a real-world IoT use case where sensors emit data in real-time. This data is sent through Apache Kafka, processed by a Spring Boot consumer, and stored in a PostgreSQL database. All services run in Docker containers with a single docker-compose file.
